# Mini Projects

This is a collection on small projects that I created to practice concepts that I learned in school and in my personal studies.
Here is a list of the projects and an overview of what was done:

* <u>**Simple Stock Algorithm:**</u>
* * Stock Prediction Algorithm using a simple moving average model and gradient descent
  * Assesed the directional accuracy of the model. **Research Question:** Does the model accurately predict when the actual price goes up and down
  * Asesed the convergence of different windows. **Research Question:** Is the directional accuracy consistant using different windows of the directional accuracy test?
