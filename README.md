# MiniProjects

These mini projects are designed to help me solidify and apply key concepts as I learn them. Each project focuses on a specific topic, allowing me to practice, experiment, and deepen my understanding through hands-on experience. This collection showcases my progress and serves as a reference for revisiting fundamental ideas in a practical context.
